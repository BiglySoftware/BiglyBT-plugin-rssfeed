RSSFEED CHANGELOG - Changes by bowman@rtfm.se
---------------------------------------------

RSSFEED 1.3.3 - 2006-11-06

reduced # thread used
prioritized torrent file guessing (when rss feed only contains url to html page)

RSSFEED 1.3.2 - 2006-10-03

BUGFIX: Fixed console UI problem

RSSFEED 1.3.1 - 2006-09-21

BUGFIX: Fixed timer and display problem

RSSFEED 1.3.0 - 2006-09-16

BUGFIX: Fixed scroll problem

RSSFEED 1.2.9 - 2006-09-11

BUGFIX: Use proper version number
CHANGE: Updated Plugin API

RSSFEED 1.2.8 - 2005-12-19

BUGFIX: Stopped invalid regular expression from breaking feed loading
FEATURE: Support self-signed SSL certificates

RSSFEED 1.2.7 - 2005-07-05

BUGFIX: Old non-tvshow-filters would not make use of smart history. For old tv-show filters you still need to use the "utilize smart history" checkbox.
BUGFIX: Build is now compatible with older java versions again (1.2.6 was accidentally built with 1.5.0_03). Solves unsupported class version.
BUGFIX: Improved error handling in case a torrent link isn't found even using the new mechanisms introduced in 1.2.6.
BUGFIX: Fixed "create filter" menu item failing if the title was misidentified as tv show and contained certain special characters.
FEATURE: Open/Copy link URL now works on feed items.


RSSFEED 1.2.6 - 2005-06-29

CHANGE: Added mechanisms to handle relative URLs in link elements.
CHANGE: Improved support for indirect links: If the plugin encounters an html page without any obvious torrent file links, it will try HEAD requests for all hrefs until it finds the right content type.
CHANGE: Old/Removed items are now only compared using the link urls, so items with changing titles (i.e including [seeders/peers] and similar dynamic indicators) will no longer cause multiple entries.
BUGFIX: Made importing the old rssfeed.options format more robust.
FEATURE: Indirect links to html with Refresh directives in the HTTP reply header are now handled.
FEATURE: Added "Maximum items to keep" settings to limit number of old/removed items kept (default 1000).
FEATURE: If a link element isn't pointing to torrent/html, the encountered content is now simply saved directly to the output dir (i.e non-torrent downloads).

- I also received some post-1.2p3-code from Martyn Allan (one of the original authors) and managed to merge the following:
CHANGE: Priority hidden for Azureus 2.2.0.0 and above.
CHANGE: Threaded save & save as from the status table menu.
UPDATE: Help has had an update.
FEATURE: Smart History now optional per TVShow Filter item.


RSSFEED 1.2.5 - 2005-05-14

BUGFIX: Old/Removed items no longer deleted on restart.
BUGFIX: History entries were saved as tvshow filter matches if their titles/locations looked like an episode mask.
BUGFIX: File save location in history entries was incorrect for single file torrents.
CHANGE: If an enclosure element with type "application/x-bittorrent" exists, it will now be used instead of the link element.
CHANGE: Disabled feeds are no longer included in a manual "Refresh all feeds".
CHANGE: Old/Removed items list reversed (recent items first).
CHANGE: Error messages referring to required Azureus settings changed to match their current names.


RSSFEED 1.2.4 - 2005-03-24

BUGFIX: Import of the old rssfeed.options format would fail for certain files.
BUGFIX: Fixed a bug that would sometimes identify torrent data as html when the link url didn't end with an explicit .torrent.
BUGFIX: Fixed a few other situations that could cause failures on startup (empty tab).
BUGFIX: Rss xml transfers that failed in mid-download would silently lock the thread forever ("Downloader" mechanisms really need to be rewritten).


RSSFEED 1.2.3 - 2005-03-02

BUGFIX: Filter test indicator would sometimes fail (not show anything at all).
BUGFIX: Fixed table width issues on OSX.
BUGFIX: Default refresh interval (global setting) was not used.
BUGFIX: Corrupt/incomplete filters/feeds avoided (no longer saved). Broken items could cause NPE on startup.
CHANGE: Improved "create filter" feature (status item menu), it should now identify tv shows better.
CHANGE: Inverted history table, the top item is now the last downloaded.
FEATURE: Added download time to history table.



RSSFEED 1.2.2 - 2005-02-27

BUGFIX: Added "support" for file:// urls to handle locally generated rss files.
BUGFIX: More typos fixed and a few minor gui enhancements.
BUGFIX: The setting for number of days to keep old items didn't work (was always 1 day).
BUGFIX: Text can now be selected and copied in info dialog.
CHANGE: Minimum refresh changed to 5 minutes (300 secs). For local files you can now use TTL to get any refresh rate.

FEATURE: New right click menu options for status tree: expand all, collapse all, open link url.
FEATURE: Added age column to status tree.

FEATURE: Added automatic import of the previous rssfeed.options format (1.2p3 and earlier), if encountered on startup.


RSSFEED 1.2 - 2005-01-31

BUGFIX: It was not possible to add new feeds or filters unless at least one already existed in the list.
BUGFIX: Certain characters (e.g [ ]) in xml elements would cause exceptions during parsing (no filters would be matched and refreshing would stop).
BUGFIX: RSS feed downloads now synchronized to avoid filters matching the same item in multiple feeds when they are refreshed simultaneously.
BUGFIX: Show info feature now works, regardless of what actually appears in the "description" element (broken html/xml stripped).
BUGFIX: Fixed a few typos.
CHANGE: Cleanup and refactoring of all source to make it easier to maintain (a lot of work remaining here).
CHANGE: Reworked persistence, any old feed/filter/history data will NOT be compatible with this build (sorry).
FEATURE: RSS feeds with links that point to an intermediary html page instead of the actual .torrent file are now handled (providing the html contains the real .torrent link).
FEATURE: Test field added for filters. Can be used to test regexp/substring matches on an arbitrary pasted string (keep in mind all filter properties are used though, including "active" and tv show ep range).
FEATURE. Items that are removed from feeds are now kept for a configurable time period (old items, but also removed/renamed/moved entries).
